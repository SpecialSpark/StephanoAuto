1. We want to run customizable autons

2. We need to explore limits of elastic, make multiple runnable auton paths

3. We need to explore limits of FRC pathplanner and/or choreo, we need to learn elastic and shuffleboard

4. we need to learn FRC pathplanner or choreo, we need to test auton paths

5. we need a reliable drive train, we need teleoperated control, we need field communication

6. We need an understanding of the command system to follow paths and schedule robot teleop

7. We need driver joystick, telemetry (robot position), drive train subsystem

8. We need strong understandings of gyro, swerve modules, kinematics (yikes) and any other mathematical magics you don't yet know
